# Project Title: 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks 🤖

# Description:

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses in various industries, including telecommunications, finance, and e-commerce. In this project, we have developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based solution to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 0.79. 🚀

# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to proactively identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., cancel their subscriptions or cease their relationship with the company) and take appropriate retention actions to reduce churn rates. By leveraging the power of ANN, we aim to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can assist the business in making data-driven decisions and retaining valuable customers. 💼💡

# Methodology:

1. # Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - We collected historical customer data, including demographics, transactional information, usage patterns, and customer interactions. 📈📋
   - Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical attributes. 🧹🧮

2. # Feature Engineering:
   - We conducted feature engineering to extract relevant information and create new features that capture customer behavior and engagement patterns. 🧠🛠️
   - Feature selection techniques were applied to choose the most informative attributes. 📊🔍

3. # Model Development:
   - We designed and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The ANN architecture included input layers, hidden layers, and an output layer. 🧠🏗️
   - Various activation functions, optimizers, and regularization techniques were experimented with to achieve the highest predictive accuracy. 🤓🔬

4. # Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the learning rate, batch size, and the number of neurons in hidden layers. 🔄🔧
   - Techniques like cross-validation were used to find the best set of hyperparameters. 🎯📈

5. # Evaluation and Validation:
   - The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 📊📈📉
   - A validation dataset was used to assess the model's generalization ability, ensuring that it performs well on unseen data. 🧐🧪

6. # Deployment:
   - The trained ANN model was deployed in a production environment, allowing real-time predictions for incoming customer data. 🚀🌐

# Results:

The ANN-based customer churn prediction model achieved an accuracy of 0.79, indicating that it correctly predicts customer churn in approximately 79% of cases. While accuracy is a valuable metric, other evaluation metrics were also considered to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. 📈✅

# Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using Artificial Neural Networks in predicting customer churn. With an accuracy of 0.79, the model provides actionable insights to the business, enabling targeted retention strategies and ultimately leading to reduced customer churn rates. As a result, the company can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize marketing efforts, and improve its bottom line. 🙌📈💰
